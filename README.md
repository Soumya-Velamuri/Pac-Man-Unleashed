Step into the pixelated world of "Pac-Man-Unleashed," a fresh take on the beloved arcade classic! Navigate Pac-Man through a series of increasingly challenging levels, each meticulously designed with a grid of dots waiting to be devoured. But bewareâ€”the ghost, with its ever-changing tactics, grows quicker with each level conquered. Your mission is simple yet thrilling: clear each level of dots without getting caught.

How It Works:

- Control Pac-Man using the arrow keys, guiding him through the maze to collect dots.
- Avoid the Ghost: A relentless foe that becomes faster as you progress through levels.
- Collect Dots to increase your score. Clearing the screen advances you to the next level.

Game Rules:

- Survive Through Levels: Start at level 1 and progress up to level 3. Each level increases in difficulty with more dots and a 
  faster ghost.
- Get Caught, Start Over: Colliding with the ghost sends you back to level 1, no matter your current level.
- Conquer Level 3 for a Special Congratulations: Succeed in beating level 3 to receive a hearty congratulations before the 
  cycle restarts, challenging you to beat your high score.
